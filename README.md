# JS Library app

A web app that can be used to list books that you have read.

## Why?

This app is mainly to work on some js fundamentals as well as practice my CSS and HTML as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) course.

## What next?

It isn't fully fledged quite yet as there is no server-side handling of data, so the information is lost after refreshing... This will be updated later on.
